//	In this exercise, we modify the accounts payable
//	application of Figs. 10.11–10.15 to include the complete functionality of the payroll application of
//	Figs. 10.4–10.9. The application should still process two Invoice objects, but now should process
//	one object of each of the four Employee subclasses. If the object currently being processed is a Base-
//	PlusCommissionEmployee, the application should increase the BasePlusCommissionEmployee’s base
//	salary by 10%. Finally, the application should output the payment amount for each object. Com-
//	plete the following steps to create the new application:
//	a) Modify classes HourlyEmployee (Fig. 10.6) and CommissionEmployee (Fig. 10.7) to place
//	them in the Payable hierarchy as subclasses of the version of Employee (Fig. 10.13) that
//	implements Payable. [Hint: Change the name of method earnings to getPaymentAmount
//	in each subclass so that the class satisfies its inherited contract with interface Payable.]
//	b) Modify class BasePlusCommissionEmployee (Fig. 10.8) such that it extends the version
//	of class CommissionEmployee created in part (a).
//	c) Modify PayableInterfaceTest (Fig. 10.15) to polymorphically process two Invoices,
//	one SalariedEmployee, one HourlyEmployee, one CommissionEmployee and one Base-
//	PlusCommissionEmployee. First output a String representation of each Payable object.
//	Next, if an object is a BasePlusCommissionEmployee, increase its base salary by 10%. Fi-
//	nally, output the payment amount for each Payable object.
